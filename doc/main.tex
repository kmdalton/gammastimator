\chapter{Simulation of X-Ray Pump Probe Experiments}

\section{Intensity Position Monitor}
At the X-Ray Pump Probe (XPP) beamline of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's LCLS, there are two beam monitors upstream of the sample position.
They are bespoke single shot intensity position monitors (IPM).
The first, IPM\textsubscript{2} is upstream of attenuator.
The second is IPM\textsubscript{3} is closer to the sample position, but suffers from less intense readings on the whole.
The IPM detectors both consist of four 10 mm square diodes (Figure \ref{ipm}).
Photons from the incident X-Ray beam are scattered by an amorphous silicon nitride (Si\textsubscript{3}N\textsubscript{4}) membrane.
Backscattered X-rays are collected on the detector panels and read out once per shot as the four intensity values $I_T, I_R, I_B, I_L$. 
The beam flux is then proportional to the sum of the panel readings, $I\propto \sum_{i\in T,R,B,L}I_i$. 
Furthermore, the position of them beam can be estimated from the panel readings as 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:position}
\begin{aligned}
Xpos &\propto \frac{I_R-I_L} {I_R + I_L} \\
Ypos &\propto \frac{I_T-I_B} {I_T + I_B}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Estimating Si\textsubscript{3}N\textsubscript{4} Backscatter}
The X-ray beam incident on the silicon nitride film is polarized in the X plane. 
The differential scattering received at each point on the detector can be computed as the sum of elastic and inelastically scattered photons. 
The elastic scattering of photons from a free electron is referred to as Thompson scattering. 
For a polarized incident photon wavevector, the Thompson scattering is \cite{Hubbell1975-fl}

\begin{equation}
\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{Th} = r_0^2 \bigg(1 - \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \phi \bigg),
\end{equation}



wherein $r_0$ is the classical radius of an electron. 
The angle $\theta$ is the angle between the incident beam wavevector and the scattered beam wavevector. 
It is very important to notice that this $\theta$ is not the same as the $\theta$ commonly encountered in the diffraction literature.
Following the notation of \cite{Hanson1986-ta}, this text refers to the diffraction angle as $\theta'=\pi - \theta$.
$\phi$ is the angle between the scattered beam wavevector and the incident beam polarization vector. 


In atoms, electrons are bound by nuclei and do not behave as free particles. 
In order to account for atomicity, the concept of the atomic form factor, $f$, was introduced. 
The form factor is a function of the scattering vector amplitude, $q = sin(\theta'/2)/\lambda$ and the atomic number of the atom, $Z$. 
$f$ can be used to compute the elastic scatter from the electrons in an atom which is referred to as Rayleigh scattering, 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{formfactor}
\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_R &= f^2(q, Z) \bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{Th} \\
                                         &= f^2(q, Z)  r_0^2 \bigg(1 - \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \phi \bigg).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The atomic form factors are estimated from quantum mechnical calculations of the electron density for each atom and are tabulated in \cite{Hubbell1975-fl}. The tabulated form factors are reported for specific values of $q$ and are quadratically interpolated in practice.

In addition to elastic scattering, electrons will also exhibit inelastic scattering wherein there is some momemtum transfered from the photon to the electron. 
In inelastic scattering, the incident and scattered photons have different energies given by \cite{Heitler1954-vq}
\begin{equation}
k = \frac {k_0} {\mu + k_0(1 - \cos \theta)}. 
\end{equation}
Wherein $\mu = m_ec^2$ the rest mass energy of the electron and $k_0$ is the energy of the incident photon. 
For the case of polarized incident light, differential inelastic scattering of a free electron can be computed with the Klein-Nishina equation \cite{Klein1929-ic}
\begin{equation}
\label{compton}
\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{KN} = \frac {r_0^2} {4} \bigg(\frac{k}{k_0}\bigg)^2\bigg(\frac {k} {k_0} + \frac {k_0} {k} - 2 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \phi \bigg).
\end{equation}
The inelastic scattering of the free electron is known as Compton scattering. 
It can be adapted via an empirical function to yield the differential inelastic scattering for bound electrons in an atom.
This is called the atomic Compton scattering and it is attained by combining the Compton scattering for the free electron with the incoherent scattering function $S(q, Z)$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{aC} &= S(q, Z) \bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{KN} \\
                                            &= S(q, Z)  \frac {r_0^2} {4} \bigg(\frac{k}{k_0}\bigg)^2\bigg(\frac {k} {k_0} + \frac {k_0} {k} - 2 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \phi \bigg).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With these formulae in place, it is relatively straightfoward to compute the differential scattering for the IPM detector system. 
The detector target material is silicon nitride. 
To the scattering cross section of it is the weighted sum of the silicon and nitrogen atomic scattering dictated by the stoichiometry of the target, Si\textsubscript{3}N\textsubscript{4}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:silicon_nitride}
\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{Si_3N_4} = \frac{3}{7}\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{Si} + \frac{4}{7}\bigg( \frac {d\sigma}{d\Omega} \bigg)_{N}.
\end{equation}

To compute the scattering onto the detector diodes, we simply need to convert the detector panel coordinates into spherical coordinates, $\theta$ and $\phi$ by the following equations

\begin{equation} \label{eq:spherical_transform}
\begin{aligned}
\theta &= \tan^{-1} {\bigg( \frac {\sqrt{(x-xpos)^2 + (y-ypos)^2}} {l} \bigg)} \\
\phi   &= \tan^{-1} \bigg(\frac {y - ypos} {x - xpos} \bigg).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Pursuant to the spherical coordinate transformation \ref{eq:spherical_transform} and the differential formula for silicon nitride \ref{eq:silicon_nitride}, we can estimate the differential scattering cross section on the surface of the IPM panels \ref{ipm_heatmap}. 
It is then possible to numerically integrate over the detector surface subject to a simulated beam position. 
Position estimates from integrated panel intensities show excellent linearity with beam positions (figure \ref{fig:ipm_position}). 
At very large deflections, thousands of microns, the estimated beam positions become sublinear (figure \ref{fig:ipm_linearity}).

Downstream of the detector by a distance z=l, is a silicon nitride film. 
At XPP, we believe that l is essentially 10 mm and that the film is 4 \textmu m thick. 
Photons scattered by the film are detected on the IPM panels. 
The scattering angle, $\theta$, is defined with respect to the forward scattering direction. 
Therefore, backscattered photons, as we detect here, are $\pi-\theta$  degrees from the Z axis. 
The backscattered photon shown above is the special case wherein $\phi=90$ degrees. 
However, in the general case, theta determines a circle in which the scattered photon can hit the detector system. 
The particular angle along that circle is given by $\phi$.

\section{Model for For Observed Reflection Intensities}
In order to generate, realistic "observations" of Bragg peak intensities, $I_h$, several factors must be considered. 
Chiefly, the reflection intensity is proportional to the square of the structure factor amplitude. 
However, the squared structure factor amplitude must be modified by several factors. 

\begin{equation}
I_h \propto F_h^2pfI_o
\end{equation}

The partiality, $p$, of a given observation is the fraction of that reflection which was observed on the detector. 
In X-FEL experiments, the X-ray pulses are too brief to move the detector during data collection. 
Therefore, all detector readouts only contain a portion of the 3-D reciprocal space volume of each reflection. 
For the moment, simulated partialities are simply drawn from a normal distribution. 
This approach finds some justification in the knowledge that Serial Femtosecond Crystallography essentially works by assuming partialities are sampled from a guassian. 
In addition to the partiality of the reflection, which is an intrinsic consequence of the crystal's mosaicity and alignment, the fraction of the incoming photons incident on the crystal needs to be taken into account. 
This is particularly important given that positional fluctions in the X-ray beam are often on the order of $\frac {1} {10}$ to $\frac {1} {5}$ of the linear dimension of the crystal. 
To compute the fraction of light incident on the crystal, $f$, we need to integrate over the X-ray beam intensity distribution. 
Here, we simply model the beam as a bivariate normal, $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ with mean values, $\mu=\{xpos, ypos\}$ covariance matrix

\begin{equation}
\Sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_x^2 & 0 \\
    0 & \sigma_y^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Where the variances correspond to the linear aspect of the x-ray beam in the x and y dimensions. Generally, these numbers are in the 10s of microns. 
To compute f, we simply integrate $\mathcal{N}$ over the surface area of the crystal. 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f = \int_A &\frac {1} {2\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y} e^{-\frac {1} {2} \big[ \frac {(x - xpos)^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac {(y - ypos)^2}{\sigma_y^2} \big]} \\
f = \frac {1} {4} \bigg[ &\bigg( Erf (\frac {xmin - xpos} {\sqrt {2} \sigma_x}) - Erf (\frac {xmax - xpos} {\sqrt {2} \sigma_x} ) \bigg)  \\
 &\bigg( Erf ( \frac {ymin - ypos} {\sqrt {2} \sigma_y}) - Erf (\frac {ymax - ypos} {\sqrt {2} \sigma_y}) \bigg)  \bigg]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{Command Line Arguments for Data Simulator}
The data simulator in Gammastimator has been designed to be reasonably flexible with sane defaults. 
The only thing that necessarilly be provided by the end user are on and off structure factor amplitudes in CNS file format.
CNS was chosen, because it is the most sane plain text format that Phenix understands. 
The command signature for simulate.py is

\chapter{Structure Factor Ratio Inference}
\section{Ratiometric Data Collection Strategy for Time Resolved Crystallography}
The goal of time resolved x-ray crystallography (TR-X), is often to estimate the difference in structure factor amplitudes for a crystal before and after some perturbation is made. 
Typical experiments use visible pump lasers to excite crystals which are then probed with X radiation after some time delay. 
A common data analysis paradigm is to construct an isomorphous difference map between the unperturbed (off) and perturbed (on) structure factor amplitudes. 

\begin{equation}
\Delta F_{hkl} = F^{on}_{hkl} - F^{off}_{hkl}
\end{equation}

Using $\Delta F$ as fourier coefficients and a high resolution structure to supply phases can give the experiment an idea of how the electronic structure of the sample was changed by the pump. 
At Laue beamlines like BioCARS, Sector 14-ID of the Advanced Photon Source, this parameter can be directly inferred from integrated data. 
Nevertheless, it is not always possible to directly infer accurate on and off structure factor amplitudes from TR-X data. 
The ratio method was invented to overcome this limitation. 
In ratiometric TR-X, the goal of the experiment is to infer the ratio between the on and off intensities. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gamma}
\gamma_{hkl} = \frac{I^{on}_{hkl}}{I^{off}_{hkl}}
\end{equation}

The intensity ratio, $\gamma_{hkl}$ of a given reflection can then be used to compute the fourier difference map coefficients, $\Delta F$. 
\begin{align}
\gamma_{hkl} &= \frac{I^{on}_{hkl}}{I^{off}_{hkl}} \nonumber \\
\gamma_{hkl} &= \bigg( \frac{F^{on}_{hkl}}{F^{off}_{hkl}} \bigg) ^2 \nonumber \\
\sqrt{\gamma_{hkl}} &= \frac{F^{on}_{hkl}}{F^{off}_{hkl}} \nonumber \\
F^{on}_{hkl} &= \sqrt{\gamma_{hkl}} F^{off}_{hkl}  \nonumber \\
F^{on}_{hkl} - F^{off}_{hkl} &= \sqrt{\gamma_{hkl}} F^{off}_{hkl} - F^{off}_{hkl} \nonumber \\
\Delta F &= (\sqrt{\gamma_{hkl}} - 1 ) F^{off}_{hkl} 
\end{align}

Using this equation in order to estimate map coefficients requires being able to infer the intensity ratios, $\gamma_{hkl}$ from TR-X data. One advantage of this technique is that the structure factor amplitudes from a reference structure acquired at a conventional beamline can be supplied for the $F^{off}_{hkl}$ term. 

\section{Estimating Intensity Ratios from X-FEL Data}
Owing to fluctuations in intensity and pointing instability in the X-ray beam, intensity ratios cannot be directly estimated from integrated Bragg peaks according to equation \ref{eq:gamma}. 
In Gammastimator, we have chosen to invoke a regularized maximum likelihood model which integrates beam position and intensity information to estimate $\gamma_{hkl}$. 

\subsection{Indices for Data Address}
We will adopt some conventions to describe indexing of integrated Bragg peak intensities, IPM data, and optimization variables.
Let the dataset consist of a number of images indexed by $i\in {1, 2, ... n}$.
Then the indexes shall be subdivided into sets as follows:
\break


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r | p{0.5\textwidth}}
$r_k$ & The set of images in run number k \\ \hline
$\phi_l$ & The set of images with an oscillation number l \\ \hline
$N$ & The set of on images \\ \hline
$F$ & The set of off images \\ \hline
$h\in H$ & Shorthand for the h,k,l index corresponding to a reflection; a member of $H$ or the set of all the reflection in the dataset
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}


Let reflection intensities by given by $I$ such that the $I_{h,i}$ corresponds to reflection $h$ of the image with index $i$. 
There are a set of metadata associated with each image which can also be indexed by i. 
Most importantly, there are the IPM readings associated with each image from which we seek to estimate the photon flux intersecting the crystal position.  
\break
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r | l}
$M_i$ & Sum of all IPM channels\\ \hline
$T_i$ & \underline{T}op    IPM channel reading\\ \hline
$R_i$ & \underline{R}ight  IPM channel reading\\ \hline
$B_i$ & \underline{B}ottom IPM channel reading\\ \hline
$L_i$ & \underline{L}eft   IPM channel reading\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Optimization Variables}
In order to recover estimates of the intensity ratios for reflections, a number of factors must be accounted for. 
Most notably, intensity and position fluctuations of the x-ray beam should be thoughtfully modeled. 
In Gammastimator, we take the total photon flux upstream of the sample position to be linear with respect to the IPM readings.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:flux}
I_i = aM_i + b
\end{equation}

Likewise, we consider the true beam position to go linearly with the IPM position estimates.
\begin{align}
X_i &= c \bigg( \frac {R_i - L_i} {R_i + L_i}  \bigg) + d \\ \nonumber
Y_i &= e \bigg( \frac {T_i - B_i} {T_i + B_i}  \bigg) + f
\end{align}

The beam geometry assumed by Gammastimator is a bivariate gaussian with zero covariance. 
Two shape parameters $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ governing the extent of the beam in each dimension are optimized during the learning. 
The linear extent of crystals in the beam is also modeled. 
This consideration is essential as crystal alignment can be off by tens of microns from dead center. 
To address this issue, gammastimator introduces four parameters per run which correspond to the left, right, bottom, and top edges of the crystal. 
These parameters, $\chi_k \in \mathbb{R}^4$, determine the integration bounds used to compute the fraction of flux incident on the crystal. 

\begin{align}
f_i = &Icryst_i / I_i \nonumber \\
f_i = &\frac {I_i} {4}  \bigg[Erf\bigg(\frac{\chi_{i,1} - X_i} {\sqrt{2} \sigma_x}\bigg) - 
Erf\bigg(\frac{\chi_{i,2} - X_i} {\sqrt{2} \sigma_x}\bigg)\bigg] \nonumber \\ 
&\bigg[Erf\bigg(\frac{\chi_{i,3} - Y_i} {\sqrt{2} \sigma_y}\bigg) - Erf\bigg(\frac{\chi_{i,4} - Y_i} {\sqrt{2} \sigma_y}\bigg)\bigg] \nonumber
\end{align}

The remaining optimization variables are the intensity ratios, $\gamma_h$. 
This accounts for far and away the largest fraction of the optimization variables. 
A typical experiment will likely include tens of thousands of $gamma$ values which need to be estimated. 


\subsection{A Regularized Model for Intensity Ratios}

The absolute deviation between a given reflection observation and an intensity ratio can be formulated as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:reflection_error}
\mu_{h,k,l} = \gamma_h  - \frac {\sum_{i\in R_k \cap \phi_l \cap N} I_{h,i} \sum_{i \in R_k \cap \phi_l \cap F} Icryst_i} {\sum_{i\in R_k \cap \phi_l \cap F} I_{h,i} \sum_{i \in R_k \cap \phi_l \cap N} Icryst_i}.
\end{equation}
To ensure the fidelity of the model with respect to the observed data, we can minimize the sum of the absolute deviations. 
I believe this is essentially equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of of the model under a Lorentzian prior on the error. 
The loss function is then simply 

\begin{equation}
|| \mu ||_1 + \rho L ||\log(\gamma)||_1.
\end{equation}
Wherein the parameter $\rho$ tunes the strength of the regularizer. The proportionality constant, 

\begin{equation}
L = \frac {|\mu|} {|H|},
\end{equation}
appropriately weights the regularizer with respect to the loss function.
