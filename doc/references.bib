              transport code EGS4 [Nelson, Hirayama and Rogers, SLAC-265] was
              made in order to include linear polarization in the simulation of
              photon scattering. Both the Compton and Rayleigh scattering
              routines were modified to properly account for the electric-field
              vector of the photon. This vector is calculated at each photon
              scatter, and is passed along with the photons in the radiation
              transport, thereby allowing for a precise simulation of polarized
              multiple scattering. A simulation of the absorbed-dose
              distribution in a soft tissue equivalent phantom for a linearly
              polarized incident photon beam, scattering many times, was

@ARTICLE{Hanson1986-ta,
  title    = "The calculation of scattering cross sections for polarized X-rays",
  author   = "Hanson, A L",
  abstract = "The scattering of low energy X-rays by atoms is dominated by
              coherent (Rayleigh) and incoherent (many times known as ``atomic
              Compton'') scattering. As electron synchrotron storage rings
              become more widely used as sources of intense, polarized X-rays,
              it is important to be able to properly calculate the scattering
              cross sections since the polarization of the X-rays can be
              utilized to reduce the X-ray scattering. This paper reviews the
              methods of calculating the Rayleigh and atomic Compton scattering
              cross sections of polarized X-rays and presents analytical
              integrations of the cross sections over solid angles of circular
              detectors from point sources into 90°. Special attention is paid
              to the effects the scattering has on the background of spectra
              collected with energy dispersive detectors. It is shown that the
              ratio of scattering to fluorescence does not approach zero for
              small values of rR (r = detector radius, R = distance to
              detector).",
