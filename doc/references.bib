  abstract  = "This chapter describes the analysis of raw diffraction data,
               used to produce scaled and merged diffraction amplitudes. The
               general description of the process is provided within the
               context of how it is performed in the programs DENZO and
               SCALEPACK. The data analysis determines many parameters of the
               diffraction experiment that impact the quality of the final
               result, providing a flexible and robust approach to problems
               encountered by crystallographers. Topics covered include:
               diffraction from a perfect crystal lattice; autoindexing;
               coordinate systems; experimental assumptions; prediction of the
               diffraction pattern; detector diagnostics; multiplicative
               corrections (scaling); global or post refinement; and control
               through a graphical interface.",

@ARTICLE{Hanson1986-ta,
  title    = "The calculation of scattering cross sections for polarized X-rays",
  author   = "Hanson, A L",
  abstract = "The scattering of low energy X-rays by atoms is dominated by
              coherent (Rayleigh) and incoherent (many times known as ``atomic
              Compton'') scattering. As electron synchrotron storage rings
              become more widely used as sources of intense, polarized X-rays,
              it is important to be able to properly calculate the scattering
              cross sections since the polarization of the X-rays can be
              utilized to reduce the X-ray scattering. This paper reviews the
              methods of calculating the Rayleigh and atomic Compton scattering
              cross sections of polarized X-rays and presents analytical
              integrations of the cross sections over solid angles of circular
              detectors from point sources into 90°. Special attention is paid
              to the effects the scattering has on the background of spectra
              collected with energy dispersive detectors. It is shown that the
              ratio of scattering to fluorescence does not approach zero for
              small values of rR (r = detector radius, R = distance to
              detector).",

              transport code EGS4 [Nelson, Hirayama and Rogers, SLAC-265] was

              photon scattering. Both the Compton and Rayleigh scattering
              routines were modified to properly account for the electric-field
              vector of the photon. This vector is calculated at each photon
              scatter, and is passed along with the photons in the radiation
              transport, thereby allowing for a precise simulation of polarized
              multiple scattering. A simulation of the absorbed-dose
              distribution in a soft tissue equivalent phantom for a linearly
